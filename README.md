### Progress track
Ready
- Risk-aversion implemented - CVaR Approach
- TYNDP-based set of 22 scenarios 

To-Do
-> to increase alpha to capture more scenaros + add +0.1 to aplha value
-> to add 0 weight (SP-neutral solution) + 0.99 weight
-> to add transmission investments - effect amplifies?
-> to set a scenario with a unique value of VoLL/VolA - how much of 'export' comes from heterogenity in values and how much form system configuration?
-> to plot output prices (time-weighted by country)

### Next meeting:
-> 18 December | Friday
